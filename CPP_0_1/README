Linux:
=======================
You need at least the following dev-packages installed on your box:
SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_image, SDL_gfx, SDL_mixer, gettext
In addition, you need CMake.
To compile and start OpenAnno type the following commands:
--------
 cmake .
 make
 ln -s src/openanno openanno
 ./openanno
--------
or use the kde based installer:
--------
 sh openanno-installer.sh
--------
or the text mode installer
--------
 sh openanno-text-installer.sh
--------
See config.xml for settings - after starting the first time there is ~/.openanno/config.xml for your personal settings - keep this in mind on svn updates.

Windows:
=======================
You need MinGW and CMake installed.
